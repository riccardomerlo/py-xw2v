mr okura wry 62yearold sit little office beside his fouremployee factory spit gob black plastic eventually end toyota honda car
picture his grandchild decorate wall behind him he smile amiably he mock his foolishness expand his factory eightfold japan bubble economy late 1980
his eye crinkle pleasantly he acknowledge his son daughter decline inherit business
he accept economic competition survival fit he will end ruthless animal digestive tract
people complain bad economy mr okura muse omiya little town nearly 200 mile southwest tokyo
look around house get everything want
get three car family around get couple television people
get washing machine refrigerator neighbor
even no one see bright future he add no feeling crisis
may japan problem life comfortable
lack crisis mentality mean japan can not summon political will lay surplus worker extinguish insolvent bank snuff hope kindly old lady run rice shop futon store
mean little public pressure prime minister ryutaro hashimoto push sweeping deregulation huge stimulus measure united state urge
japanese foreign economist mostly agree farreaching restructuring necessary invigorate second large economy world
japan widely see catch bramble regulatory barrier stifle competition finance retail transportation medicine critic often say without deregulation japan will continue stagnate last seven year sap strength united state country
indeed clinton administration sometimes suggest japan verge economic collapse portray japan threat entire global economy
sit tatami mat floor japanese home like masamitsu nishi omiya life still seem secure people feel little urgency change
mr nishi former honda worker now run construction company 40 employee say business terrible he add his family neighbor scarcely affect downturn
indeed people omiya say not know anyone ever lay
unemployment japan record high still just 3
6 percent percentage point rate united state
inflation zero
interest rate lower slump japan boom america
not much feeling downturn among ordinary people mr nishi say despite japan slightly negative growth last year
he relax cushion floor nurse coffee tranquil night air he add even family business not good not cut back living standard
although japan endure bad slump quartercentury political discontent not boil united state
indeed ruling liberal democratic party steadily gain strength people like mr nishi his wife kazuho perceive central government remote neither problem nor solution
mrs nishi say just not see sign crisis
change say goodbye old value takahiro tanaka one experience underscore overwhelming task will transform japan modern market economy
businessman like mr tanaka slim 37yearold work forester omiya his factory go last year operate environment social economic
mr tanaka sit back friend home omiya day describe his failed business base not contract price rather traditional value girininjo duty empathy
result japanese economy whose outward facade skyscraper business suit whose human interaction still root traditional concept honor
way business frustrating american official immediately understandable 18th century samurai
mr tanaka charge 30yearold family business make pearl souvenir accessory
peak several dozen employee just kind inefficient factory become uncompetitive japan rise get hard compete import he recall
chinesemade pearl come japan finished product price cost material
family business steadily decline lose money year year
girininjo mr tanaka not take costcutting step might save his business
keep think employee he say
depend us
just not bring dismiss inefficient one
think offer employee less money
sure accept offer
just not bring thing
last year mr tanaka finally close factory employee lose work anyway
mr tanaka readily admit his sense girininjo misplace bit foolish
think person great ability might business he admit
mr tanaka nearly everyone else omiya believe girininjo economy inevitably wither away process evident disappearance small shop
japan far britain nation shopkeeper japan twice many shop per capita united state
little shop inefficient mostly charge high price survive web girininjo
store appeal not mind customer pocketbook loyalty day not enough
friend near think since her refrigerator get old maybe she buy new one us say yachiyo horie run little electronics shop her husband nobuhiro
one day her house see new refrigerator think hey well not say thing
finally casually say see new refrigerator
she not want talk
mrs horie shake her head sadly
now even sister buy electrical thing big store she say
like her new washing machine
mr horie look reproachfully his wife
new television he add
trap nice warm bath hard leave expression japanese nurumayu describe coziness lukewarm bath even someone know time step naked tub face chill
many japanese say nation economy nurumayu realize time get bath lull can not summon energy just yet
frankly just soon stay young banker town near omiya
day even try stay bath tub will crack water will leak
stay risk get chilly catch cold
not much choice
people like mr takayama problem economic restructuring price fairness equality civility
foreigner japan often seem virtually socialist mindset profoundly believe social equality rely progressive income tax system major country world including marginal rate 65 percent personal income tax achieve equality
soviet union collapse think socialism fail capitalism better say mr takayama express epiphany seem odd coming banker dark suit usually think big capitalist economy outside america
visit singapore one slum next
surprised maybe japan place kind thing not happen place everybody think middle class
mr takayama brood minute
he add not want get bath
cultural difference may also behind japanese antipathy unregulated market
american risktaker teach respect explorer entrepreneur japanese drill cautious respect bureaucrat
japan intuitively riskaverse japanese language traditionally not even good word risk
japanese often turn popsociology account difference describe farming people contrast hunting people west
effect japanese tend see economic herbivore contrast carnivore wall street west
sure image like china korea invade terrorize japanese soldier nor image resonate american european company maul japanese manufacturer 1980
within japan image seem natural one japanese business indeed extremely reluctant hurt consequence disdain economic carnage free market
shinji hashikura 42 run fiveemployee factory make electrical part omiya sit his kitchen table express his feeling common japanese say jaku niku kyo shoku strong gobble meat weak

80 percent japanese weak meat
gobbling begin will dead
mr hashikura sit beside him kitchen table
way future he say
nothing can
competition import now shove weak aside mr hashikura comment suggest broad agreement omiya sweeping change come create economy base concept strong gobble meat weak
indeed many people favor say even consume economic darwinism interest nation
say even though omiya 5700 people loser open system
rural area omiya economy largely dependent government spending infrastructure project inefficient little retail shop factory supplement farming forestry can not easily compete import
kihachiro nishimura silverhaired retired salaryman sit tatami floor his living room liquor shop fill front his house
deregulation rise large market kill his store he muse change still worthwhile

media always report damage cause never benefit rain
feel sorry typhoon
economic typhoon might destroy his store business he say japan whole still benefit
sure economic typhoon still not horizon japan economic structure clearly change nonetheless not suddenly not much united state want still profoundly

mr hashimoto try every way he can become competitive he say he particularly strike he hear friend run car dealership

impressed attitude
think friend soft his business management now reach stage become obsolete japan economic structure change challenge people like yasuo murata
mr murata run sawmill omiya he hardhit opening japan economy

ultimately accept
no way
sense mr murata face economist joseph schumpeter call creative destruction
something japan use good one secret success century economic adaptability willingness allow industrial euthanasia uncompetitive industry extinguish capital labor reallocate rise industry
1950 45 percent labor force engage farming now 3 percent
1950 60 japanese worker labor coal mine churn cheap clothing shoe now mine garment factory close shift make automobile sell stock
last decade economic flexibility erode sharply government intervene regulation protect people destruction inefficient shop factory
economy become arthritic rigid resulting misallocation resource account part stagnation recent year
day flexibility return japan economy cycle business destruction creation seem start
good deal economic pain place like omiya seem arise process creative destruction may eventually lead renewed economic growth
take mr okura man whose little factory churn black plastic part car cheerfully admit his factory loser
his family underscore cycle economic change take place japan
mr okura parent farmer just japanese he born 1930
farming become uncompetitive 1960 just entire nation ride manufacturing boom prosperity
now mr okura factory likely fade away long his child already take generational baton new direction his daughter interior designer his son software engineer develop electronic money credit card company
his child success comfort him reassure him economic change however painful scary worthwhile
deregulation inevitable mr okura say
challenge figure people like
